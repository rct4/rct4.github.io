# About Me
I am a Master's student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Science. I graduated with a degree in Computer Engineering with honors from UIUC.

I have interned at Intel and Northrup Grumman, with experience with High Performance Computing, scripting and automation, benchmarking, and networking.

In my free time, I love playing badminton and exploring the Pacific Northwest.
